To determine the transpose of say matrix M , MATLAB does it as  M.' (M followed by dot followed by apostrophe). Either one is legitimate when dealing with  vectors or/and matrices containing solely real numbers. Care should be exercised when dealing with complex numbers. For example, when M=[2  -3], M'=M.'=[2 ; -3] . However if  M=[-3+4i  -3-4i], M'=[-3-4i ; -3+4i] and M.'=[-3+4i ; -3-4i]. Apart from that, an excellent video. Thank you.",2024-07-07T14:53:02Z

In this video you just play with numbers and forms of matrixes, which may be interesting for kindergarten children, but do not report anything useful for people working in science.

You have, at first, colsp(A)=span(c_1, c_3), and then after showing that colsp(A)=rowsp(A^T) you say that colsp(A)=span(d_1, d_2). Does this mean that span(c_1, c_3)=span(d_1, d_2)?
If that is the case, can you clarify how the spans are equal, but the vectors themselves are not?",2023-10-10T11:12:48Z

2022-10-05T20:55:21Z,@ChristopherLum,_M0mOHn0ink,"Very good point, unfortunately this video was filmed using a slightly older version of Matlab.  Matlab comes out with new versions every 6 months and usually they are small changes but as you can see, some of the updates change the UI.  There are typically no breaking changes in terms of code/syntax but keep your eye out in the future.  I will try to mention areas where there might be discrepancies in the future.",2022-10-05T20:55:21Z

Great to watch through once and then skip around in order to look for specific functionality. The greek symbols sections was my favorite! 'esc' l 'esc' is much better than \[Lambda]. I also like the word processing capability -- like LeTex but with a calculator. One question, is there a shortcut for the vector notation? I've being using Basic Math palette, but haven't gotten the given shortcut to look as good as just selecting the vector notation itself.",2021-10-09T04:48:46Z

2021-10-08T01:48:25Z,@zaneyosif,mXFDAz3S9Uk,"AE 501: Super helpful tutorial. I've never used mathematica before so this was really helpful. Seems like compared to Matlab its a much more expansive version of the command window in matlab. And a much better way to visualize calculations with the addition of text and greek symbols and what not. I wonder what are the benefits of using mathematica vs. matlab and I presume its going to be based on your need. I am much more used to matlab and creating programs to run through several calculations for large sets of data, but it seems like using mathematica is much more helpful for visualizing single calculations.

1. I'm having a hard time deciphering when to use { } vs. [ ]. Is there an easy way of memorizing which parentheses are used in what occasion? It's a bit confusing vs. how MATLAB basically uses ( ) for everything except for maybe matrices and some others.
2. Is there a reason why I sometimes get ""->"" after hitting ""Enter"" after a plot description like ""AxesLabel"" automatically, and sometimes I have to type it in manually? I apologize if that doesn't make sense..

2020-10-10T17:26:59Z,@sethwhittington28,j-utznrXmcY,"I am so glad to have these introductory videos as reference for AE501. Unlike a typical classroom lecture, I can rewind the video if I miss a portion as follow along at my own pace. That being said, I have been following along in my own Mathematica notebook for these videos and I am taken back by the speed at which you can efficiently input script into both Mathematica and MATLAB, while simultaneously reserving enough processing power to give a detailed lecture. I frequently have to back up 10 or 15 seconds and re-watch a section because I was too focused on inputting script. This format is great for that, but if this were a live classroom lecture and I had no ability to rewind, I would miss a LOT of material in trying to keep up in my own file.

Question:
With some plotting detail functions in Mathematica, pressing enter when the autofill appears will generate an arrow on its own. However sometimes I noticed you need to enter a -> (arrow) manually in order to obtain the correct syntax for the function to work. Why does Mathematica generate the arrow automatically for some functions, but other times you need to create one manually?",2020-10-10T17:30:24Z
2020-10-10T20:02:43Z,@ChristopherLum,j-utznrXmcY,"Seth, good question, I'm still not fully familiar with when Mathematica will auto-complete things like arrows for you.  For the arrow, if you just try to draw the arrow with ASCII art (type '-' then '>'), the next time you hit spacebar, Mathematica will replace it with the arrow symbol.  I'll show some other tricks in future videos.  Let me know if you run into any other interesting behavior.",2020-10-10T20:02:43Z

We played with Simulink and an Arduino for my Senior Capstone Project  at Michigan Tech where created  a physical 3D Ferris wheel (and a simulation of the Ferris wheel) that could be driven by students in MATLAB simulink with various PID values to try and teach students about PID controls and the importance of creating a stable system. We made carriages for lego people so when the wrong pid values were entered and sent the system into a frenzy the lego people would shuffle or fly around and the carriages would rock about!,2024-10-12T19:40:24Z

The order of x and y, however, can be reversed intentionally, or negative sign be added, to achieve different purposes. For instance, atan2(x, y) follows the North-Clockwise Convention, and atan2(-x, -y) follows the South-Clockwise Convention, and these two conventions are often used in the solar energy industry as discussed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_azimuth_angle#A_formula_based_on_the_subsolar_point_and_the_%7F'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-00000009-QINU%60%22'%7F_function",2021-04-15T22:13:52Z

With the implementation of atan2(*), do you think there is still a need to include the atan(*) function? I’m trying to think of a scenario where having accurate quadrant information contained in the output of the function would be both problematic and difficult to deal with. I’m probably overlooking something, but it seems to me that the software developers could’ve just written the logic tree into atan(*) such that atan2(*) would not be necessary. It seems like in most cases this would result in a simpler user experience. Maybe they felt it was important to have a function that would match the output of a scientific calculator?",2020-10-13T07:46:56Z

Chris, in your version of polar notation that doesn't use e^jtheta, but z<theta, you put z instead of theta. Any reason for that? 

Also, I see in the second homework that we are to prove cos(theta) = (e^jtheta-e^-jtheta)/2... In your lecture, I'm not sure why the series you arrive at to get euller's equation is actually representative of e^jtheta. Is that just a definition of e^jtheta? If, so I'm not sure how e^-jtheta should be represented, as I imagine that would be key to solving part a of problem 1. From previous classes, I know that e^-jtheta = costheta-jsintheta. However, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to use that to solve problem 1a. I'll look around and see what I can find on my own regardless. I was just a bit confused by that part.

It was still a little tricky understanding at poles F(s) is infinity and therefore sticks out of the plane. Its almost like F(s) acts like a z value (on a real plane) and sticks out of the page, but how does that pertain to the complex plane? I really think a 3D plot of a complex function would be helpful to visualize, because for most of the video I was thinking in 2D until you introduced F(s).",2021-10-17T14:47:14Z

Maybe I missed it but I am having trouble understanding what this third dimension is on the real and complex plane. Also, does this mean that for the zeros the function is on the plane?

If complex numbers can be represented on a plane, can the idea of a graphic representation be extended to complex functions?  While it's easy to imagine functions like y  = x, it's not very easy to imagine y = s where s might be a complex variable. Not sure if this is a legitimate question, but I just had this thought as I watching the last part of your video. Thanks!",2021-10-16T00:08:42Z

I  think it would’ve helped me out personally if the video had started out with maybe a quick reason of why I care about Euler’s formula. For example: in the previous ODE video, if I recall correctly you quickly showed what an ODE was and how it might be used. THEN went into more complex topics and derivation. I have spent a good portion of this video so far trying to figure out why I need to care about Euler and am over halfway through. I’m sure you’ll get there eventually... just some feedback for those who think like me.",2020-10-13T08:05:48Z
2020-10-13T14:46:22Z,@ChristopherLum,WEYX-wa9csU,"Seth, thanks for the feedback, you make a very good point.  To answer your question, the reason we need Euler's Formula is that we'll use it down the road when working with underdamped/oscillatory systems which introduce sin/cos terms.

I am confused on why we can make this assumption and what would happen if it were not positive, would the laplace transform then not be possible since it no longer goes to 0 as t goes to infinity? 

Also, what does it mean for s to be positive? does this mean that both real and imaginary components must be positive?

Thank you",2021-10-16T20:45:26Z
2023-08-21T00:07:16Z,@carultch,q0nX8uIFZ_k,"The short answer for what s represents, is complex frequency.  It is a mixture of a real component that corresponds to exponential decay, and  complex component that corresponds to sinusoidal oscillation.  The Laplace transform scans the original function for a spectrum of amplitudes as a function of all values of s with a positive real component, and any imaginary component.

Since s being negative would correspond to exponential growth, rather than exponential decay, negative values of s generally aren't applicable to reality.  For exponential terms with positive poles, you get the explosion of exponential growth, which is considered unstable.

There is the bilateral Laplace transform, that considers s being negative.  I'll leave it to you to search for more about it.",2023-08-21T00:07:16Z

I do not understand why the limit using FVT would not go to zero? Since it's s*X(s). I get that X(s) goes to 1/k as you showed but it's being multiplied by s which would make it s*1/k = 0 * 1/k = 0?

Edit: s is a complex variable which I am sure it makes it different... but I can't seem to figure out how to interpret correctly

Edit2: Nevermind, I see now that the equation you wrote is equivalent to sX(s) so you can take the limit of that equation directly.",2021-10-15T04:34:25Z

Referring back to the FVT, looks like we're in the time domain. i.e. x(t) not X(s). Good stuff. Seems powerful, though I could see this getting quickly out of hand with functions that are significantly more complex than a step function. Seems useful in applications where you're seeking the long term response, maybe like determining whether or not aircraft flutter will dampen out or not..?

1. 4:09 Does Matlab have an alternative to putting zeros in the matrix for all the powers we don't have in our polynomial? For example, for a polynomial with a large exponent such as 5x^78 + 3x^2 + 5... , would there be a shortcut to putting in over 70 zeros into the matrix? 
2. At 6:00, why did you include an underscore after the s, and why was Mathematica ok with this when you used just ""s"" instead everywhere else after that?

Hey Chris! One of my favorite things about seeing the videos arranged in this way (and I guess binging them like I have been) is how clear the throughline is between what we want to do and how to do it.

Its clear to see that:
1. We want to solve for a function that gives us the position of something at a time (x(t))
2. We have a model of the behavior of our system, but it is a multi-order differential equation, and so a pain to solve traditionally.
3. So, we are going to do the following:
     a. Put it in the laplace domain.
     b. Solve for the function there.
     c. Partially expand our result
     d. Take the inverse laplace. 

And boom. You have your position at a given time. Or, if you don't feel like taking an inverse laplace, you can check if you can predict a study state with the FTV.

I know what I said is kind of obvious, but for some reason this whole process wasn't as clear for me when I first learned it in undergrad. Thanks for helping connect all the dots now!",2021-10-17T00:12:41Z

Important for clarity on why having higher orders in numerator is not a huge concern since these systems are not really physically possible. I assume this can also act as a check if you are writing your differential equation of a system and get you higher orders in numerator, it means you've constructed the initial differential equation incorrectly.",2021-10-16T03:06:09Z

2019-10-13T18:28:31Z,@ChristopherLum,Cvu2zWk3gYw,You are correct.  If you are doing quick analysis then a transfer function is easier.  Initial conditions do not affect stability of linear systems so you can often get away with just looking at transfer functions.,2019-10-13T18:28:31Z

Maybe using a network analyzer to capture magnitude and phase.  Signal source in and Capture wave forms out.   Motor Drive hardware is controlled via microcontroller.   Sending commands sends the motor to position.  I am thinking we would bypass the microcontroller and step after the micro giving us the analog real time version of the model.

2022-02-24T06:43:09Z,@mihirsanjay4577,sF_sjFqNFUk,"for those who are using R2021b some tweaks are to be made as described below
11:42 you will see an extra variable (probably named ans) in your workspace once 'sim('PendulumModel.slx')' command is executed.
13:55 Now after that when you create an outport(yout) in simulink and run the code, you wont see any other variable getting added to your workspace.
that is because the 'yout' variable will be created under the variable that was previously generated(probably named ans). 

Due to this you wont get the output you are expecting, to get the appropriate output just change code line, at
15:17 thetasignal = yout.getElement('theta');        to   thetasingal = ans.yout.getElement('theta');

also to check the yout variable in command prompt , 
14:05 type 'ans.yout'+enter

19:31 to get signal dimensions
go to debug  ------>  information overlays ------->signals------->signal dimensions

23:58 'simX' & 30:38 'logsout' is similar variable to 'yout'. Change the code in similar way.",2022-02-25T08:40:27Z

2021-12-29T03:34:39Z,@Apocobat,sF_sjFqNFUk,"Idk if its a quirk or I missed something in the video, but in order to access yout, I have to use out.yout as everything from the model is stored in an out parameter. Not sure why this is, and it seems like not many have this issue, but regardless, this is super helpful and will help me automate a ton of stuff. I'm working with motor models as a side project and running different parameters, voltages, etc and recording steady state/time delay etc and plotting, something that I knew could be done, but had no idea how to do it, seems very possible now. If i wanted to sweep 3-24V, record the steady state to an array, and plot the array, I could very easily do this, even juggling multiple models (comparing simulink parameters and simscape physical sims).

I used Simulink a lot in my aero undergrad but I haven't used it quite as much post grad so this was super helpful shaking the rustiness of the bones. I was curious though how you were able to get the labels on the scope plots, I didn't see any options to label the title/give an x or ylabel. You could probably output the data to matlab and then plot from there (spoilers for the next video ha!) but I just wanted to know if the use of scope was limited or not.

The Simulink model is also runs from 0 to 10 sec, but 1) it runs at t1 Simulink-time-step, 2) at each t0 time-interval it gets D data from Matlab, 3) it  outputs data, called outData (initial outData=0) at each t2 time-interval.

I can get the output to save as a .mat that I can then recall and modify in my matlab script from the editor, but it won't output anything either using the output or output to workspace functions in simulink even when I change to array.

When we solve ODE's for the state, that's describing how the system itself behaves? whereas, if we want to know outputs that depend on the state (i.e. sensor readings), we would have to be given separate y(t) equations? I had always been confused when to use state-space representations vs. when not to because when I first learned ODEs, the term ""output"" seemed to be used to describe both the system response (state) and outputs dependent on the state.",2021-10-24T17:31:05Z

Mathcad does not have an expm() function like Matlab so I had to write my own which is basically using the original definition.   This is necessary for calculating the discrete A and B matrices.     I just calculate from n =0 to 7.   This is possible because I really need to do expm(A*delta_t).   The delta_t makes all the elements small so they don't ""blow up""  Too much time was wasted with the Ps.   The Ps are not necessary.

Professor Lum, 
First of all, great video. Helps explains the mathematical theory behind generating 3D plots. I never understood what Matlab was doing behind the scenes as you plug in equations/functions, so this video helps demystify the topic. I think my biggest takeaway will be understanding that Matlab is actually using the mesh *product* of x and y to evaluate f(x,y). I assume this evaluation can be extended to 3D scalar functions, it just becomes more difficult to actually visualize.",2021-10-29T18:17:45Z

So you use the show function to have the surface, line, and point all show up in the same plot and each object is it's own definition (i.e Plot3D, ParametricPlot3D, Graphics3D). How would you be able to attach a legend to the combined plot to designate what each is? Usually when I've used just one plotting method to plot in mathematica there is an option for legend but since we are using multiple plotting methods for the different objects and then combining them together via ""show"" function I'm curious how you would be able to add a legend (and to that fact other attributes like axis labels and plot titles). Does show have that ability? But overall, thanks for the great video!",2021-11-01T23:20:09Z

I've always been fascinated by its formal structure as a type of **""outer product""** between two fundamental mathematical objects:
1.  The function (or vector of functions) \( \mathbf{F}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \)
2.  The vector of partial derivative operators \( \nabla = \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \right) \)

Their ""product"" \( J = \nabla \otimes \mathbf{F} \) yields a matrix ( (1,1) tensor) whose components \( J_{ij} = \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j} \) precisely measure the tangency of the function \( \mathbf{F} \) to the coordinate axes defined by our partial derivatives. It's the natural object that tells us how the output space is stretched and rotated by the map \( \mathbf{F} \) which is why the determinate of the Jacobian is a pushforward. 

This geometric view connects beautifully to your point about total sensitivity since `J_ij = ∂F_i/∂x_j` precisely measure how the function stretches, shears, and rotates the coordinate axes—quantifying the 'sensitivity' or 'tangency' you described, but in the language of differential geometry and tensor analysis. This perspective unifies the calculus and linear algebra behind it beautifully.""

Having watched this video to the end, I caught where you said that you were going to approach machine learning from a control systems point of view (neural networks). I am looking forward to this. About two years ago, I took my first step in the direction of machine learning with a video that I made concerning Augmented Reality, and here is the link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKi0TFinFhg  . I used a fairly generic software algorithm at the time called YOLO (you only look once). I look forward to a deeper understanding of the back propogation path which I am sure that you will show in terms of neural networks, which is a level ""deeper"" than machine learning.Training the algorithm took about two days...could have been better but I had had enough.  At present, I am learning Python for DSP applications, which one could just call mathematical python. Most of machine learning, other than those that program their GPU's in CUDA are done in Python. BTW, my first programming language that I learned as an EE was Fortran, which I programmed with ""punch cards"", which, was kind of a nightmare. I also did a video, when I was getting my A&P on explaining why a propeller needs a twist, which you can see here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohcwMSK_Yfs&t=774s.  That was done in Solidworks.

2024-09-09T16:20:41Z,@bosanova1643,tfpLFQB-7sU,"I think it should be seen as leverage effects in a chain. If I have two levers connected and equal, a small amplitude variation on the first lever will be reproduced with the same amplitude at the end of the second lever. Depending on the length of the levers, the amplitude of the variation can be multiplied or reduced (demultiplied), allowing for adjustments in the range of movements",2024-09-09T16:20:41Z

Won't -pi/2 to pi/2 just cover the positive z axis, i.e. the points starting from the x-y planes and going up in the positive z direction. Would we be able to describe points in the negative z hemisphere if we were to apply these constraints? To me 0 to pi makes sense. -pi/2 to pi/2 is giving some trouble. Can anyone please explain?",2024-09-20T11:00:47Z

I can see how calculating work for each side could be a big endeavor is the boundary is defined by a complex shape. - Natalia Ermoaleva,2023-11-03T18:48:09Z

An uncompensated unity feedback system with certain deficiencies has no zeroes and poles at -1, -2 and -5. Answer the following questions based on the above description of the system
a)	Determine using an apt technique, the gain of the system at damping ratio 0.45
b)	Include a series compensator to the uncompensated system with zero at -0.0111 and pole at -0.01. 
c)	Include a series compensator to the uncompensated system with zero at -0.1 and pole at 0
d)	Display on a single plot, the step response of all three systems above.
e)	Tabulate the settling time, rise time and steady state error for each of the three systems

PS: the other spikes you see in the PSD are basically the same note but shifted octaves above. For instance in this case you will have peaks at k*256 Hz with k=1,2,.. and the highest peak correspond to the octave of the note you are playing on the instrument.

I know that the quasilinear PDE introduced here has a different form than both linear and non-linear but what are some of the defining behaviors that make it different from the other two? Does it behave linear most of the time then non-linear under special boundary conditions?",2021-11-18T06:23:27Z
2021-11-18T06:29:51Z,@ChristopherLum,THjaxvPBGOU,"Orkida, that is a good observation but unfortunately it has hard to predict behavior for those types of problem.

around the 48:00 mark, when you choose functions for f(x) and g(y), are they truly arbitray? would any combination work as long as f(x) is only dependant on x and g(y) is only dependant on y? if not, how did you choose those equations?

Also, at 40:00 I think you added a negative symbol to P where it shouldn't be.you have -P=-P_y when it should be -P=P_y. it looks like it was then fixed in the next line and you still ended up with P_y/P=-1 which should be correct",2020-11-18T00:41:56Z

Towards the end of the video, you went through an example of solving a PDE. After seeing you walk through the example, it made sense to me how you solved it, but the path to the solution seemed a bit abstract. First, you had to recognize where you wanted to get which was to be able to write the differential equation in the form p'/p such that when you integrate, you would be left with log[f(t)]. This is not something I would've easily recognized and as such it seems unlikely that I would've easily solved this PDE. Hopefully in one of those future videos you mentioned we will see a more direct and bulletproof method of solving PDE's...",2020-11-17T06:28:20Z

Also are their examples where this wouldn't be positive? We shouldn't see a negative density (Note: if you find something with negative mass please let the physicists know). So the only way I see this working is in a negative tension ergo a compression which I wouldn't really expect to display the same wave behavior.",2023-11-20T01:52:00Z

2023-05-21T23:54:18Z,@dragonslayer98767,IAut5Y-Ns7g,This was such a needlessly complicated way to derive the 1D Wave Equation. You could have simply taken the sum of both vertical tension components and tended the sum towards the limit of delta(x) -> 0. You'd get the formal definition of a partial derivative to describe tension and be able to skip 10 minutes of convoluted trigonometry. Missing stuff like this demonstrates a lack of actual understanding to the laws you're applying - you've clearly just blunt force memorized the most complicated explanation from a Real Analysis textbook.,2023-05-21T23:54:18Z

Question: at about 15:54 you divide by T but give no reason. Is this meant to get us to tan(b) - tan(a)?,2021-09-10T12:06:30Z

2021-08-16T17:49:44Z,@yesiam4935,IAut5Y-Ns7g,13:44  I dont understand T being equal to the cos component. The greater force is on the vertical and x component is practically zero how does the x component   is equal to the force we are applying in the vertical direction? we apply force in y direction and since the rope is at rest I expect the tension being the reactive (balancing) force in the opposite direction of the force we exert and there shouldnt be any horiztontal component at all actually this is newton's law but strings are not like free bodies I understand that but I still dont understand. Please could you help me understand how is Tsin = T,2021-08-16T17:49:44Z

2021-08-16T18:00:08Z,@yesiam4935,IAut5Y-Ns7g,I thought the tension is same everywhere on a string this may be where I get confused how are there two different tensions on the same string? Strings are very confusing. First of all you took dx as a curve which suggests there are other forces exerting on it and it is still a string. Should it be a straight line instead? how is T1 and T2 are not equal and T?,2021-08-16T18:00:08Z

QUESTION:
Chris, when solving for the tension vector in the vertical direction around timestamp 17:00, it seems like the tension in the vertical direction should be 0 by inspection, right? No further free bodies or equations required. You previously drew on the assumption that alpha and beta angles are very small in order to say that the horizontal components of T are equal. Since the alpha and beta angles are very small, you stated that cosine(small angle) = 1. By that argument, i would claim that sine(small angle) = 0, making the vertical component of T = 0 by obvious inspection. I haven't finished the video yet, so maybe you address this soon, but at the moment i am pretty confused about the seemingly conflicting information.

After finishing the video, we never simplified the equation by claiming that the vertical component of T, (or T*sine(small angle)) was equal to zero. Can you elaborate?",2020-11-17T06:44:52Z

2019-12-26T00:59:43Z,@solokototelluride,IAut5Y-Ns7g,"Nice derivation. I have a question though.You end up with a proportionality between the second derivatives with respect to time and space. Your approach is geometrical and you are looking for the wave equation as an expression for the amplitude. On the other hand if you derive the Schrodinger equation (also a wave equation) and in this case you are also modeling the amplitude of a wave albeit with special interpretations. Instead of a geometric approach, the Schrodinger  equation derives from energy considerations. But you would think you would come up with the same wave equation and you are just taking two different approaches. Yet you do not. Schrodinger's equation does not include a second derivative with respect to time at all!  So, you are in both cases developing the equation of a wave. Both equations are expressing the amplitude in terms of time and space propagation. Why do you end up with different equations? What is the interpretation< the meaning?",2019-12-26T00:59:43Z
2019-12-26T03:20:21Z,@ChristopherLum,IAut5Y-Ns7g,"Thanks for the excellent and detailed comment.  Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the energy approach to deriving the wave equation.  That being said, in my experience when applying the energy method to conservative systems such as this, they usually arrive at the same result.  I'll take your word for it that it is different but if so, that is indeed surprising.",2019-12-26T03:20:21Z
2019-12-26T04:32:42Z,@solokototelluride,IAut5Y-Ns7g,@ChristopherLum Thanks for the quick reply. Both solutions cannot be equivalent so I would like to have a deeper understanding as to why they are different. You are a smart guy and I know you could figure it out and explain it clearly. I can do this on my own but I would think you would find this interesting. Here is one link to the energy approach to deriving schrodinger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsX5iUKNT2k,2019-12-26T04:32:42Z

2019-03-29T15:43:36Z,@ChristopherLum,IAut5Y-Ns7g,"Ashwyn, that is a great question.  If the deflections are large, some of the assumptions do not hold true so the solution we obtain may no longer be accurate.  Depending on the desired fidelity of the model, this may or may not be acceptable to you.  Of course, there are many other large assumptions we make when building the model so it is important to realize that this is just a mathematical approximation of the system.  A system with large deflections will likely still display some of the characteristics predicted by the model.",2019-03-29T15:43:36Z

Also are their examples where this wouldn't be positive? We shouldn't see a negative density (Note: if you find something with negative mass please let the physicists know).

2023-05-21T23:54:18Z,@dragonslayer98767,IAut5Y-Ns7g,This was such a needlessly complicated way to derive the 1D Wave Equation. You could have simply taken the sum of both vertical tension components and tended the sum towards the limit of delta(x) -> 0. You'd get the formal definition of a partial derivative to describe tension and be able to skip 10 minutes of convoluted trigonometry. Missing stuff like this demonstrates a lack of actual understanding to the laws you're applying - you've clearly just blunt force memorized the most complicated explanation from a Real Analysis textbook.,2023-05-21T23:54:18Z

The greater force is on the vertical and x component is practically zero how does the x component   is equal to the force we are applying in the vertical direction? we apply force in y direction and since the rope is at rest I expect the tension being the reactive (balancing) force in the opposite direction of the force we exert and there shouldnt be any horiztontal component at all actually this is newton's law but strings are not like free bodies I understand that but I still dont understand.

2021-08-16T18:00:08Z,@yesiam4935,IAut5Y-Ns7g,I thought the tension is same everywhere on a string this may be where I get confused how are there two different tensions on the same string? Strings are very confusing. First of all you took dx as a curve which suggests there are other forces exerting on it and it is still a string. Should it be a straight line instead? how is T1 and T2 are not equal and T?,2021-08-16T18:00:08Z

QUESTION:
Chris, when solving for the tension vector in the vertical direction around timestamp 17:00, it seems like the tension in the vertical direction should be 0 by inspection, right? No further free bodies or equations required. You previously drew on the assumption that alpha and beta angles are very small in order to say that the horizontal components of T are equal. Since the alpha and beta angles are very small, you stated that cosine(small angle) = 1. By that argument, i would claim that sine(small angle) = 0, making the vertical component of T = 0 by obvious inspection. I haven't finished the video yet, so maybe you address this soon, but at the moment i am pretty confused about the seemingly conflicting information.

After finishing the video, we never simplified the equation by claiming that the vertical component of T, (or T*sine(small angle)) was equal to zero. Can you elaborate?",2020-11-17T06:44:52Z

2019-12-26T00:59:43Z,@solokototelluride,IAut5Y-Ns7g,"Nice derivation. I have a question though.You end up with a proportionality between the second derivatives with respect to time and space. Your approach is geometrical and you are looking for the wave equation as an expression for the amplitude. On the other hand if you derive the Schrodinger equation (also a wave equation) and in this case you are also modeling the amplitude of a wave albeit with special interpretations. Instead of a geometric approach, the Schrodinger  equation derives from energy considerations. But you would think you would come up with the same wave equation and you are just taking two different approaches. Yet you do not. Schrodinger's equation does not include a second derivative with respect to time at all!  So, you are in both cases developing the equation of a wave. Both equations are expressing the amplitude in terms of time and space propagation. Why do you end up with different equations? What is the interpretation< the meaning?",2019-12-26T00:59:43Z

2019-03-29T15:43:36Z,@ChristopherLum,IAut5Y-Ns7g,"Ashwyn, that is a great question.  If the deflections are large, some of the assumptions do not hold true so the solution we obtain may no longer be accurate.  Depending on the desired fidelity of the model, this may or may not be acceptable to you.  Of course, there are many other large assumptions we make when building the model so it is important to realize that this is just a mathematical approximation of the system.  A system with large deflections will likely still display some of the characteristics predicted by the model.",2019-03-29T15:43:36Z

I started looking into the way pianos are designed and created a little Matlab program to show the frequency of each note, some chords, scales etc...

Does the 1D-wave equation also apply to the way sound is transmitted from a piano hammer/string to its soundboard? I was wondering if the vibrations in a solid piece of wood or plate (transferred by the hammer - string - bridge connection) are described in the same way. - Elizabeth Sampley",2021-11-22T16:55:22Z

2018-12-10T06:37:24Z,@ChristopherLum,lMRnTd8yLeY,"Good observation.  We obtain large deflections in the numerical simulation purely because we used somewhat unrealistic constants for the problem.  If you use realistic values for tension (T) or linear density (rho) you will obtain deflections that are indeed small compared to the length of the string.  However, the unrealistic values we use do not affect the concepts/framework of the solution process, they are merely convenient to numerically simulate.",2018-12-10T06:37:24Z

I couldn't find an Eq. 2 in the notes. Is Eq. 3 meant to be labeled as Eq. 2? Just want to make sure I keep track of the important equations.

Seeing a similar problem really helped focus on what made the heat equation distinct from the wave equation. In particular it's interesting to see how this builds on the wave equation by seeing the effects of the initial heat distribution causing a change in our resulting behavior.

In the first part of the video, around the 4:00 minute mark you wrote that u is a function of (x, y, z, t). This makes sense. However, then when you took the laplacian of u, you only took the derivative of u with respect to x, y, and z, but not with respect to t.

2020-11-24T04:36:20Z,@sethwhittington28,KAS7JBztw8E,"AE501:
Professor Lum, similar to in your one dimensional video, I am confused about the assumptions made regarding small angle approximations when summing vertical forces. REF timestamp 17:30.
You noted that since theta was small, we could assume that the Cos(small angle) = 1, and as a result, the horizontal forces cancel out. By that logic it seems to me like a similar argument could be made to the vertical forces such that SIN(small angle) = 0, meaning that the vertical forces would also cancel out and the sum of the forces in the vertical direction = 0. Am I missing something?",2020-11-24T04:36:20Z
2020-11-24T04:54:58Z,@ChristopherLum,KAS7JBztw8E,"Hi Seth, the small angle approximation is that cos(theta) =1 and sin(theta) = theta.  You can see why if you plot sin and cos and look at the functions at small values of theta.",2020-11-24T04:54:58Z

2020-11-24T05:30:54Z,@sethwhittington28,KAS7JBztw8E,@ChristopherLum I am also confused about how density * area = mass. Typically we see density * volume = mass but in this lecture it looks like we have density * delta x * delta y = mass.,2020-11-24T05:31:38Z
2020-11-24T06:54:01Z,@ChristopherLum,KAS7JBztw8E,@sethwhittington28 In this case we define density as mass per unit area.  You are correct that this is non-standard but is how the problem is setup.,2020-11-24T06:54:01Z

This consistency has helped me intuit next steps and understand grow more confident with the steps of solving these types of PDEs. The structure also makes the derivation and solution an effective lecture block for me to do back to back with a well situated break in the middle.

I'm taking a class where we need to use this method, but I haven't taken a numerical methods class or anything beyond the barest intro to differential equations. I looked through a lot of other resources trying to understand quickly, but none of them made sense at my level of background knowledge. I've come to really appreciate teaching styles like this where you include enough information so people who haven't been immersed in this stuff recently can still learn what they need to know––it turns out extensive prereqs actually aren't needed to get a working knowledge of a lot of concepts and techniques!

OK. That explains a lot.
In fact it explains most things. like the insanity of the last year.

2020-12-09T03:27:42Z,@ChristopherLum,kbV9LdQXVtg,"Beni, good observation.  However in many situations you are at a specific point other than the origin and you will need to approximate the function at this location.  As such, it is actually better to just learn the Taylor Series as the Maclaurin is just a special case of the Taylor Series.",2020-12-09T03:27:42Z

I didn't like the first part of the video because there was too much time wasted writing on a white board.  I also think it would be faster to simply make a small step and keep stepping in the same direction as long as the MSE keep dropping.
I have some test data that is very difficult for GD to minimize.   There are 5 parameters, and the ""terrain"" is more like the Colorado river cutting and winding its way through the Grand Canyon.  The path is very narrow and always changing.   I don't have high hope for the this  Armijo algorithm.   I have found the brute force line search along with the coordinate search work best.  All methods work well if the ""terrain"" is like a bowl.    Nelder-Mead would be MUCH faster than the GD with Armijo.

2021-12-12T19:00:14Z,@jasonfranklin4614,Uz3B9fVb4LQ,AE501:  This method really makes leaps in efficiency and requires some tuning.  It looks useful as a tool to explore model behavior as well as solution space for those unfamiliar cost functions.  It probably would help to have a deeper understanding of the specific forms of cost functions and how they behave physically...a little like studying PDE's...Gotta make sure I hop in the right hole,2021-12-12T19:01:00Z
