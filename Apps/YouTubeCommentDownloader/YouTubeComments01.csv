When we solve ODE's for the state, that's describing how the system itself behaves? whereas, if we want to know outputs that depend on the state (i.e. sensor readings), we would have to be given separate y(t) equations? I had always been confused when to use state-space representations vs. when not to because when I first learned ODEs, the term ""output"" seemed to be used to describe both the system response (state) and outputs dependent on the state.",2021-10-24T17:31:05Z

For an aircraft, this might include things like airspeed, AoA, etc.  However, if you don't have sensors to measure all these, then the outputs might be a different set of signals that are derived from the states.

For the nonlinear 6 DOF dynamic model, I expected something about the term  ω ⃗×H ⃗, where H ⃗=(I_x p,I_y q,I_z r) which will cause nonlinear pitch instability as shown in my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG2-mu6I11A. I believe this nonlnear pitch instability is the root cause for two recent 737 Max crashes.

I enjoy the tutorials you post on your YouTube channel and I thank you.

I am very interested in studying the field of tilt-rotor drones. But I didn't get a proper understanding of these types of drones through the articles. Can you help me to understand the model of this type of drones? Can you provide me with an instructional video or a resource that explains the modeling of these drones in detail?

Regarding the equation we derived for the AoA of the tail, I did not quite understand the reasoning behind why one of the terms was proportional to the pitch rate and horizontal distance to the tail. This discussion was at the 41:30 mark.",2023-02-09T03:49:11Z
2023-02-09T04:17:57Z,@ChristopherLum,bFFAL9lI2IQ,"Miles, good question.  This is simply how they chose to model the dynamic pitch dampening effect of the tail.  This is attempting to add behavior which makes it difficult to pitch the vehicle at a high rate.  When q is large this creates a large AoA of the tail which in turn actually creates a negative pitching moment which counteracts the pitch rate.  You could get a similar effect by adding this to the moment equation but for whatever reason, they chose to model it here.  Let me know if you want to chat more about this at office hours.",2023-02-09T04:17:57Z

2020-08-14T02:43:37Z,@GabrielDemetriusSilva,bFFAL9lI2IQ,"EDIT: NVM, I saw that the table 2.4 is NOT at the body frame.

Original:

At around 1:30:37 you said that the moment due to the engine is 
cross (mu , Fe)

You defined mu as being 
mu= [Xcg - XAPT;
         YAPT - Ycg;
         Zcg - ZAPT]
Why is only the Y component ""backwards""?

I thought the moment should be something like
rCG=[Xcg ; Ycg ; Zcg]:
reng=[Xeng ; Yeng ; Zeng];

r = reng - rCG

M = cross (r , Fe)

just like at 1:20:08",2020-08-14T03:56:06Z

2020-09-18T20:21:04Z,@faitevebooks6919,bFFAL9lI2IQ,"Thank you Prof. Lum. It is nice to have your videos of talking about the flight mechanics. For the nonlinear 6 DOF dynamic model, I expected something about the term  ω ⃗×H ⃗, where H ⃗=(I_x p,I_y q,I_z r) which will cause nonlinear pitch instability as shown in my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG2-mu6I11A. I believe this nonlnear pitch instability is the root cause for two recent 737 Max crashes. You can also found my presentation about this claim at  Slide 13 in http://www.aiaahouston.org/Horizons/ATS2019-Presentation-SS-Tang.pdf. I appreciate your thought about this phenomenon.
